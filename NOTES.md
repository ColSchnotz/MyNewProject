VS Code Source Control Workflow:

1 📁 Source Control panel (left sidebar)
2 ➕ Stage files (click + next to files)
3 💬 Write commit message in the text box
4 ✅ Commit (Ctrl+Enter or click checkmark)
5 🚀 Push (click sync icon or ... menu → Push)

💡 Pro Tips to Keep Info Accessible:
1 Bookmark this chat - if your browser allows, you can bookmark this conversation
2 Save the README.md - I created a comprehensive README in your project with all the setup info
3 Use the NOTES.md - I created this file for you to add your own notes
4 VS Code integrated terminal - you can always open a terminal in VS Code (Ctrl+ `) that will be in your project directory

The README.md in your project has all the setup instructions, so you'll always have that reference!

Now go ahead and try staging that NOTES.md file in the Source Control panel - you should see it listed under "Changes" and you can practice the VS Code Git workflow! 🚀
